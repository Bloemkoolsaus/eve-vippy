<h3>October 18, 2016</h3>
<b><u>STATISTICS</u></b>
 - Some of statistic collection was still relying on the IGB. Fixed that.
   Unfortunately, this means that from the moment the IGB got removed (11th) until today (18th) some statistics may be inaccurate!!!

<b><u>MAP</u></b>
 - Fixed a bug in the recently-scanned marker.
 


<h3>October 17, 2016</h3>
<b><u>MAP</u></b>
 - Set destination via CREST is working. You may need to re-authenticate your characters with CREST to get it working.
 - Fixed system-notifications. Adding new notifications was broken.
 - Fixed known-systems management. Was broken also...

<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Re-introduced the <strong>Exit-Finder</strong>!
 - Fixed several errors that were popping up at random places.



<h3>October 11, 2016</h3>
<b><u>CREST</u></b>
 - CREST is here. <a href="/help/crest" target="_blank">Tell me all about it</a>.
 - Unfortunately, some features that depended on the IGB are now gone temporarily.
  	- Set destination to a system
  	- Exit finder
  	These features are still possible with CREST, i just haven't gotten around to them yet. I expect to be able to add them in the coming days.

<b><u>MAP</u></b>
 - Getting rid of the IGB means we can use new technologies. So, background changes/improvements were done to the map.
 - Removed 'Mass Delete' mode. It has since been replaced by the two remove options in a systems right-click menu.
 	- 'Remove [systemname]': Removes that system.
 	- 'Remove connected systems': Removes all systems connected to this system. Remove a connection and then use this to remove that part of the chain!
 - Add a CITADEL signature type that behaves just like a POS signature.

<b><u>ADMIN</u></b>
 - CREST does not have the option (yet) to see corp-roles. Therefor, it is not possible to see who is a director.
   Everyone that had admin, is now added to a usergroup that gives you admin roles instead. You can edit who is a member of that group to add/remove admins.



<h3>August 3, 2016</h3>
<b><u>STATISTICS</u></b>
 - Updates to statistics/leaderboard.



<h3>April 28, 2016</h3>
<b><u>STATISTICS</u></b>
 - Statistics/leaderboard for non directors/admins could show an empty page.
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>

<h3>April 21, 2016</h3>
<b><u>STATISTICS</u></b>
 - Stat pages for previous months were broken. They are now available again.
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Fixed adding or updating a capitalship in Profile. It could give errors on certain solarsystems.
 - wh.pasta.gg died and is replaced by <a href="http://wh.vps-city.com/" target="_blank">wh.vps-city.com</a>. Updated the links.



<h3>March 10, 2016</h3>
<b><u>STATISTICS</u></b>
 - Correctly track the amount of wormholes mapped.
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Updated to <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-march-2016-release" target="_blank">YC118.3</a> data export.



<h3>February 29, 2016</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Add an option on maps to not automatically name new solarsystems.
 - Add an option on maps to not create an unmapped wormhole when a new wh signature is found.
 - Add marker for systems that are marked persistant (<img src="/images/eve/pin.png">). These will not be deleted by 'DELETE ALL' or 'Remove connected systems'.
 - Editing signature: Fix a bug that disabled save on enter.
<b><u>STATISTICS</u></b>
 - Add amount of wormhole systems mapped to statistics.
 - Add an option to rank the leaderboard based on amount of systems mapped, instead of amount of signatures scanned.
<b><u>ADMIN</u></b>
 - Add an option for your access control group to also require manual authentication for each user by an admin.
 - Add an option to add/remove systems that Vippy will calculate and show the distance to (tradehubs).



<h3>February 8, 2016</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Added an option in "Profile -> <a href="/index.php?module=profile">Account Settings</a>" to change the wormhole-type field back to a dropdown box, instead of the current text field.
    I have had complaints since removing it. This way, every one can choose wich they like best.
<b><u>ADMIN</u></b>
 - Add an option to enable admin access to non-directors.
 	<i>Set these roles by creating a user-group and adding users to that group</i>.
 - Add an option to disable admin access to directors.
 	<i>You can set this option at your Access Control Group. Please make sure you don't disable access for yourself lol!!</i>.




<h3>January 10, 2016</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - When editing signatures, replaced the wormhole type select-box with an auto complete field. This should make it easier to select the correct wormhole type.
{if numeric_naming}
 - If a chain is set to autonaming wormholes as "<i>Numbers (by static)</i>":
	- VIPPY will now attempt to guess the correct wormhole type based on the signature info field (that should contain the next wormholes name).
		<b>For exemple:</b>	If you are in the 121 (a c4 with statics X877 and C247).
				Name a wh sig 121-1211 and vippy will assume that sig is a X877. Name it 121-1212 and a C247 will be assumed.
	- VIPPY will check if the next wormhole name is correct based on the signatures.
		<b>For exemple:</b>	You are in the 13 (a c4 with statics X877 and N766).
				13-1 (<i>the way back</i>) is the static (<i>the X877</i>). There are 2 other wormholes in the 13: The 13-132, and 13-133. The 133 is also a c4.
				Until now, if you jump into the 133 VIPPY will map it as 131, wich in this scenario is not correct.
				If you've correctly set the 13-1 signature to X877, VIPPY should now know that 131 can not exist and correctly name the new system 133.
{/if}
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Extended the map legend as people have mentioned to me it was missing some things. (click blue "I" icon at the top right of the map).
 - Removed zoom buttons. They haven't been working for a long time.




<h3>January 2, 2016</h3>
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Per request, added an option for every chain to restrict certain actions (such as reposition system, delete system, etc).
    CEO and Directors can set these on the admin tab in managed chains.

<h3>August 21, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Jumplog: Per request, allow addition of custom mass amount to a wormhole jump log.
 - Signature list: On small windows, the info hover on a signature would fall off screen. Moved info hover panel on screen on small windows.




<h3>July 19, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SERVER</u></b>
 - Succesfully moved vippy to a new server at a different hosting company.
        As most of you guys will have noticed, the previous one had to much interuptions.




<h3>July 10, 2015</h3>
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Updated to <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-aegis" target="_blank">Aegis</a> data export.

<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Updated to <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-carnyx" target="_blank">Carnyx</a> data export.
<b><u>FIXES</u></b>
 - Fixed an out of memory exception that could occur when adding a wormhole between systems when neither system was already on the map.




<h3>May 19, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - When copy pasting more then 2 signatures, check for old signatures that are no longer in the copy paste and remove them.
 	This will automatically clear old signatures. If the signatures was a wormhole, try find the matching wormhole and close it's connection.
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Fixed the error that caused Vippy to go bananas last weekend.




<h3>April 28, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Improved signaturelist layout for (very) small windows (such as mobiles devices or small windows in the IGB)
 - When jumping through a wormhole connecting 2 kspace systems, VIPPY would not map it.
 	It will now check if the 2 systems are directly connected by a gate. If not, VIPPY will now assume a wormhole map the systems.
 - Improved the auto mapping layout algorithm.
{if isset($App->user) && $App->user->hasRight('atlas')}
<b><u>ATLAS</u></b>
 - Fixed menu ATLAS link.
{/if}
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - Updated to <a href="http://community.eveonline.com/news/patch-notes/patch-notes-for-mosaic" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> data export.
{if isset($App->user) && $App->user->getIsDirector()}
 - Add an access control group page. All directors can now set wich corporations have access to VIPPY.
{/if}
<b><u>FIXES</u></b>
 - `Delete all Signatures` also deleted POS signatures. Deleting all sigs will now keep POS signatures.
 - Popups (such as edit connection info) would not center on screen if you scrolled horizontally.




<h3>February 10, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Add visual for Shattered systems.
 - Add a `delete all signatures` link.
<b><u>WH-INFO</u></b>
 - Add support for shattered Systems
<b><u>FIXES</u></b>
 - VIPPY said A009 goes to nullsec, but it doesn't. It actually goes to one of the 25 Small-Ship Shattered systems.




<h3>February 5, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Improved layout for small windows (such as mobiles devices or small windows in the IGB)
 - Moved `mark fully scanned` button to a less prominent place. Systems are automatically marked fully scanned when you complete all signatures.
 - Automatically update connection wormhole-type from signatures list.
 	VIPPY will attempt to automatlically set a connections type by looking at the signature list.
 	If a wormhole signature's info field has the name (not the J-sig) of the wormhole in the proper syntax, it can match the connection.
 	VIPPY will take the first word as name parameter.
 		If you have `c5a-c5b` as info for that wh signature, VIPPY will be able to match the correct connection and update accordingly.
 		These values will all map to c5b: 	`c5a-c5b eol`	`c5b`	`c5b eol frig`	`c5a-c5b frig bubbeled whatever`
 		These values will <u>NOT</u> map to c5b: 	`frig c5a-c5b`	`j123456-1654321`	`j123456-1654321 c5a`
 - Show lifetime/mass of a wormhole in the on-hover connection info when a wormhole-type is known.
 - More code optimizations for improved server-side performance.
<b><u>WH-INFO</u></b>
 - Updated wormhole mass table.
 - Updated wormhole color reference.
 - Add wormhole system effect reference.
<b><u>FIXES</u></b>
 - Fixed `Remove Connected Systems`. Unmapped systems would delete the whole chain instead of only the actual connected systems.
 - Fixed jump-log layout. Every first line of mass after `Marked Reduced` would not go to a new line, messing up the table.




<h3>January 18, 2015</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Improve copy-paste signatures usability.
 - Include your own status on the leaderboard.
 - Server optimizations.


<h3>December 22, 2014</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - In response to popular reque, change the fully-scanned icons to bars. Whenever there is a grey bar on a system, this means more scanning is required!
	Bars can be different height:
	 * Large bar: Not scanned at all. Get your lazy bum out of that forcefield and start scanning;
	 * Small bar: Previously scanned, but more then 2 hours age. Check for new sigs.
 - Attempt to auto mark systems as fully scanned. For exemple when there are no more open signatures, or when a copy-past adds no new signatures.
 - Auto-check connections to Thera using data from <a href="http://www.eve-scout.com/" target="_blank">http://www.eve-scout.com/</a>.
 - Removed the `Copy-Paste sigs` popup, and put it in a folding pane in the page. This should make copy-pasting sigs quicker as the popup could take a while to load.
 - Add an option in the context menu to remove all systems currently connected to the selected system. (remove part of a disconnected chain).
 - The ingame browser button `Switch active system to current location` had become lo, wandering through the universe and has now magically returned.
 - Re-done and improved the algorithm that positions new systems on the map.

<b><u>FIXES</u></b>
 - Fix broken statistics / leaderboard pages.
 - Fix signatures hover info popup.




<h3>December 8, 2014</h3>
<b><u>VIPPY</u></b>
 - CCP's data export is going to be late, as usual...
 	- Added a work-around for the new systems such as Thera that VIPPY does not know yet because of the SDE being late.
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - When scrolling horizontally, make only the map scroll. Keep all other page elements inside the browser viewport.
 - When manually adding mass:
 	- Add the ability to select a ship-class instead of only a specific shiptype.
 	- Ability to add multiple records
 	- Mark manually added mass on the jumplog
 - Add a button to mark a system fully scanned.
 	- <img src="/images/default/scanned.not.png"> Unmarked system will have an `unmarked` icon at the top right.
 	- <img src="/images/default/scanned.recently.png"> Marked systems that were marked over 2 hours ago will have also have an icon.

 - Wormhole stubs:
	- Improve parser for the wormhole stub names.
 	- Added a naming help for wormhole stubs. See the `map legend` (<i>click the blue <img src="/images/default/info.png"> at the top right of the main map</i>).




<h3>October 20, 2014</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Create a wormhole stub while scanning. (<i>Temporary, unmapped wormholes</i>)
 	- To create a stub, add a WH signature to the sigs list. In the info field of the signature, provide the name for the new wormhole.
 	- If the stubs are named correctly, VIPPY will be able to correctly replace stubs with the mapped wormholes when you start mapping.
 - Limit the number of capitals in range on popups to 5 capitals (<i>unless more then 5 are within 1 jump</i>).
 - Set destination to nearest tradehub system (<i>Unfortunately, the ingame browser does not support set-destination to station</i>).
 - Show icons for wormholes that can fit capitals. (<i>VIPPY will attempt to automatically deduce these based on connected systems</i>)
 - Manually add mass to a wormhole.
 - Improved the responsiveness of the signatures list.




<h3>September 3, 2014</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Make auto-naming wormholes optional per chain.
 - Adjust signature editor. Signatures now keep their IDs after downtime.

<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Automatically name systems (c5s, c5a, c5b, etc). Yes, you're reading this right. It's in now.
 - Jump log mass estimates were in m3. This should ofcourse be kg....

<b><u>ADMIN</u></b>
 - Creating new chains was broken. Is fixed now.



<h3>May 29, 2014</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Add mass estimates to jump logs.
 - Improve internal caching (performance should be better!).



<h3>April 17, 2014</h3>
<b><u>Statistics</u></b>

 - You are now able to define if you have a capital ship in k-space. Go to `profile` > `My Capital Ships`.
   If a capital ship is in cyno range of a connecting k-space wormhole, VIPPY will show a cyno icon  (<img src="/images/eve/cyno.png">).
   	<i>* By default, VIPPY will assume jump drive calibration 4. You can change this at `Profile` > `Account Settings`</i>
 - Limit the number of active characters shown on the map in a certain system.
 - Fixed an issue when calculating if a high-sec system is an hs island or not. 0.45 systems were seen as lowsec, while they are not.



<h3>December 23, 2013</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Fixed the `on-map` tradehub calculation.
 - Add icons if a HS is on a hs-island (<img src="/images/eve/stargate.red.png">).
 - Add icons if a LS has a direct gate to hs (<img src="/images/eve/stargate.green.png">).

 - Allow directors to ban users from VIPPY.



<h3>Januari 17, 2013</h3>
<b><u>PERFORMANCE</u></b>
 - Add `tracking-only` mode for the ingame browser on alts. This mode will not show/load the map, wich will decrease client and server load.
 	You are encouraged to use this mode on your alts, the map is very CPU heavy for your client.
 - Hide the signature list by default. It is not needed all the time, and when hiding it will decrease server load (and thus increase VIPPY performance).
 - Cached the wormhole info popups when you hover over them on the map.
 	Wormhole effects for exemple were calculated for each call, wich is lame cause they never change.
 - Did some other very technical stuff to decrease load for the server.

<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Add `Known Wormholes`. This will make other aliance holes (or hostile holes) easy to spot when they appear on the map.
 	<i><u>Directors</u> and <u>CEO's</u> are able to edit the list of known wormholes in the admin section.</i>
 - Show number of jumps between connected k-space systems. Connect two k-space systems by clicking `add wormhole`, then enter both system names.
 - Add `snap-to-grid` button that will neatly arrange all systems on the map. Or atleast try to...
 - Rename the `clear-all` button to `Delete All` to better describe it's function.
 - Add notification system. Add a notification to a system by right-clicking the system on the map if there is important stuff about a certain system.
 - Add `set destination`. Set destination while on the ingame browser by right-clicking the system on the map.
 - Fixed a bug in the `show-online pilots` popup.



<h3>November 11, 2012</h3>

 - Signal Strength column is added when copy-pasting signatures from the ingame scanner window.
 - Fix and improve wh-activity graph generator.

<b><u>WH-COLORS</u></b>
 - Add a table of all different wormhole colors to and from what class of system. Every wormholer should know this by heart though.



<h3>August 22, 2012</h3>
<b><u>SCANNING</u></b>
 - Add system information, including npc/pvp kill statistics when you hover over a system on the map.
 - Add wormhole info to the signature-hover window.
