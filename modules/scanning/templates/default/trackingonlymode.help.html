	<h2>Tracking-Only Mode</h2>
	<p>If you enable tracking-only mode, this VIPPY client will <u>not</u> load the map and VIPPY will only track the location of you character.</p>
	<p>The rendering of the map takes a bit of resources from you computer, opening VIPPY on multiple clients can affect the performance of the eve-client. Enable tracking-only mode on your alts if you experience problems.</p>
