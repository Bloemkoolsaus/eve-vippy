		Hello explorers,
	</p>
	<p>
		Up untill today, Vippy was (still) using the CREST and XML api's.
		These technologies have been deprecated by CCP for a while now, and CCP is shutting them down in May 2018.
		The are replaced by <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/article/introducing-esi/" target="_blank">ESI</a>.
		This new api is supposed to be faster, more reliable and it has more features (including write access to some degree).
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Vippy</b> has now switched to the new ESI api and because of that <strong>all</strong> your CREST tokens have become invalid.
		This means you <strong>have to generate a new ESI token for every character</strong> you have/want on Vippy.
		You can do this in your <a href="/profile/account" target="_blank">profile</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have any questions or need any help?<br />
		Please <a href="/help/contact" target="_blank">contact</a> me.
	</p>
