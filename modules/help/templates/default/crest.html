		<h3>SSO and Vippy</h3>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			You will now use your EVE login to login to Vippy.<br />
			This will give Vippy access to CREST.
			<span style="color: #ffffff;"><b>Under <u>no</u> circumstances is Vippy able to read or otherwise get your EVE login information.</b></span>

		<h3>CREST and Vippy</h3>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			With the death of the Ingame Browser, Vippy relies on CREST for authentication and tracking.
			With CREST, Vippy can confirm that you are who you say you are and can track your location for valuable intel on your map.
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<b><u>Authentication</u></b> was previously done with API keys. Although they still work, and will work for quite some time,
			I opted to replace them for CREST, since we need CREST anyway. No more juggling of API keys :)
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<b><u>Tracking</u></b> was previously done with headers from the ingame browser. Now that the IGB is going away,
			we need to use CREST to get your location and active ship-type.

	<h2>CREST Tracking</h2>
	<div class="col6">
		<h3>CREST Fleet API</h3>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			Vippy's main method of tracking is via the CREST fleet api. This requires you to add your fleet to Vippy.
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<b>Fleet api has a couple of limits:</b><br />
			<ul style="margin-top: 0; padding-top: 0;">
				<li>When your fleet changes boss, the new boss will have to re-add the fleet!!</li>
				<li>Fleet information can only updated every 30 seconds (this is the same lag as ingame)<br />
					<i>Read character-location-api section to learn how to refresh your location faster.</i>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<b>Adding your fleet:</b><br />
			At the bottom of the map there is a button 'Add Fleet', use that to add your fleet.
			You will need to enter the fleet boss and the CREST link for your fleet. You can find your link via the fleet window ingame.
		</div>
		<div style="clear:both;"></div>
	</div>
	<div class="col6 right last">
		<h3>CREST Character Location API</h3>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			With those restrictions on the fleet api, why are we even using that?
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<b>Ship type</b><br />
			The character location api does not provide any information about your current shiptype.
			We cannot use this to log mass on wormholes for the jumplog.
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<b>Rate limits</b><br />
			Authenticated CREST (wich is what we use here) has a really, really (like really) low rate limit. This means
			Vippy can only do so many request in a given time. If Vippy needs to use the character location api to track
			all active characters, and honor the rate limit imposed by CCP, it would need 15 minutes for a round trip.
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			Add to that, we need to also call this api to check wether or not a character is even logged in!
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			<h3>Solution!</h3>
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			To get around the rate limit and the slow update rate of the fleet api there are now 2 new buttons on the map page.
			These buttons will update your location NOW, using the character-location api. This is usefull when you've just
			jumped into a new hole and want to start scanning right away.
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			Click the button, choose a toon and Vippy will try to use the character-location api to fetch your current location.
			Ofcourse, your toon needs to have a valid CREST token.
			<a href="/profile/characters" target="_blank">Check your character status here</a>
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			In your <a href="/profile/account" target="_blank">account settings</a> you can select your dedicated scan-alt.
			If selected, you will have a second button that automatically selects your scan alt and refreshed it's location.
		</div>
		<div style="padding: .5em;">
			To prevent abuse, these buttons will be rate limited!!
